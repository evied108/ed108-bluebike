### Research question
Is there any correlation between the number of Bluebike rides and their average duration and the number of MBTA rides in a sample of Bluebike and MBTA rides from July 2018-January 2025? 
Secondary question: Does the introduction of the Bluebike subsidy program in October of 2023 affect the amount of Bluebike rides taken?
